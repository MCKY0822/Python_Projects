I’ve been learning Python by working through open-source tutorials, watching YouTube guides, and solving real problems from client projects.
These resources have not only deepened my understanding of Python but have also given me practical insights into problem solving
and web developement. I'm excited to use what I’ve learned in future work and keep growing as a developer.
